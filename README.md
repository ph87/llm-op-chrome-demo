# Chrome Bridge

Chrome extension + native host bridge for:
- running JavaScript on browser tabs from terminal commands
- opening an in-page chat sidebar (from the extension icon) and relaying chat with native-host managed agents

## Recommended Interaction Model

- Primary path: interact through the in-page chat sidebar and AI agent (`codex-acp` logical agent).
- Native host is usually driven by agent chat messages from the extension.
- CLI/scripts are still available, but mostly for debugging, diagnostics, and manual operations.

## How It Works

1. `scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh` sends requests to `native-host/app.js` over HTTP (`127.0.0.1:3456`).
2. `native-host/app.js` forwards tasks through Chrome Native Messaging.
3. `chrome-bridge-extension/backgroud.js` executes JavaScript in tabs and returns results.
4. Clicking the extension icon injects `chrome-bridge-extension/sidebar.js`, which splits the current page with a right-side chat panel.
5. Chat messages are relayed through native messaging; native host spawns and manages one agent session per tab.

Native host name: `chrome_bridge`

## Project Layout

- `chrome-bridge-extension/` - MV3 extension with background service worker.
- `native-host/` - Node.js native messaging host + launcher.
- `scripts/` - installer, CLI, and helper scripts.

## Chat Sidebar

- Click the extension icon on a normal web page to toggle the sidebar.
- Layout: main page shrinks to ~3/4 width and chat sidebar uses ~1/4 width.
- Header includes a settings button that opens the settings view.
- Settings currently exposes `codex-acp` (single agent for now), but the UI is ready for additional agents.
- Native host currently keeps one spawned chat process per tab.
- Chat commands:
  - `/page <instruction>`: injects current tab context (tab id/url/title) and asks agent to act on that tab.
  - `/help`: shows available chat commands.
  - Command implementation lives in `chrome-bridge-extension/commands/` (`index.js`, `help.js`, `page.js`).
- Auto mode:
  - On the first non-command chat message in a tab, extension auto-binds `/page` context for that tab.
  - After auto-bind, follow-up messages in the same tab keep using that page context until chat is closed.
- Runtime config:
  - `chrome-bridge-extension/runtime-config.js` controls pluggable defaults (`defaultAgentId`, `autoContextEnabled`, `autoContextCommand`) so background logic does not hardcode command/agent names.

## Agent Configuration

By default, native host maps `codex-acp` agent id to a true ACP protocol adapter:

- command env: `CODEX_ACP_COMMAND` (default `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex-acp` via launcher)
- args env (JSON array): `CODEX_ACP_ARGS_JSON` (default `[]`)
- adapter env: `CODEX_ACP_ADAPTER` (default `acp-rpc`)
- mode env: `CODEX_ACP_MODE` (default `acp_rpc`)

Fallback compatibility mode is still supported:
- `CODEX_ACP_ADAPTER=codex-acp`
- `CODEX_ACP_MODE=codex_exec_json`

Optional multi-agent map (future-ready): set `AGENT_COMMANDS_JSON` to override/extend agent command specs.

## Agent Adapter Library

Native host agent integrations are extracted into:

- `native-host/agents/index.js` - agent registry + session bridge
- `native-host/agents/adapters/codexAcpAdapter.js` - `codex-acp` integration
- `native-host/agents/adapters/stdioAdapter.js` - generic stdio/text/jsonl adapter
- `native-host/agents/utils.js` - shared executable/path helpers

To add another LLM agent, add a new adapter file under `native-host/agents/adapters/` and register it in `native-host/agents/index.js`.
Main host flow in `native-host/app.js` does not need agent-specific changes.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- Google Chrome
- Node.js (available as `node` in `PATH`)

## Setup

### 1) Load the extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked` and select:
   - `./chrome-bridge/chrome-bridge-extension`
4. Copy the extension ID.

### 2) Register native messaging host

From repo root:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh <EXTENSION_ID>
```

Example:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh ghnogoimmjgbgmmkkkdkfkjalaajfhbk
```

This writes the manifest to:

`~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/chrome_bridge.json`

Reload the extension after install.

## Manual Usage (Optional)

The following commands are useful for local debugging and manual operations.  
In normal workflow, prefer the extension chat sidebar + AI agent.

Health check:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --health
```

Execute JavaScript on active tab:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --code "document.title='EXEC_OK'"
```

Execute JavaScript on specific tab:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --code "document.body.style.background='gold'" --target-tab 123456
```

Execute JavaScript by URL pattern:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --code "document.title='DONE'" --target-url-pattern google.com
```

Open a URL:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --open-url "https://www.google.com"
```

Read host events:

```bash
./scripts/chrome-bridge-cli.sh --events
```

List all tabs across all windows:

```bash
node scripts/list_tabs.js
```

## Helper Scripts

Open URL:

```bash
node scripts/open_url.js --url "https://www.google.com"
```

Take screenshot:

```bash
node scripts/screenshot.js
```

Click element:

```bash
node scripts/click.js --selector "button[type='submit']"
```

Fill input:

```bash
node scripts/input.js --selector "input[name='q']" --text "hello world"
```

## Troubleshooting

- `--health` cannot connect:
  - Make sure Chrome is running.
  - Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`.
  - Re-run `./scripts/install.sh <EXTENSION_ID>` if needed.
- Command times out:
  - Check target tab or URL pattern.
  - Try a simpler command first.
- No visible page change:
  - Avoid restricted pages (`chrome://*`, Web Store, etc.).
